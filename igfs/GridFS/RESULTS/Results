Results:

1) It streams data and stores the data in form of chucks and files.
2) During the program creation, if you directly run the entire code, it shows errors such as db.collection not found.
So I tested it, and realized if a collection does not exist then first you need to create it, other
wise it doesn't work.

3) imp: Does not support mp4 files. it upload the mp4 file, but when I tried downloading it, it 
did not open.
However, it does support mp3 files and also allows manipulation of the mp3 files. Which is pretty cool. It allows editing.

4) Definitely faster than simple CRUD operations.

5)Ran out of memory (HAHA)

6) AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: ifError got unwanted exception: failed to connect to server [localhost:27017] on first connect [MongoNetworkError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017]
Again the MongoDB error.

After a particular number of iterations, I need to purge MongoDB. Inside stuff (THATS WHY WE NEED
FORMAL VERIFICATION, hehe)

Crashed after 75*76 = 5700 iterations
