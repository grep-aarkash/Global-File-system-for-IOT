Results:

For my PC which has very high configuration (32 GB RAM and 1 TB hard disk)
1) Since here during every write call, we were connecting it to MongoDB, MongoDB eventually crashed. Had to purge and re-install everything.

2) The script does nested iterations to calculate the amount, which seems to be rising consistenly, and the behaviour is quite similar to what we had expected it to be.

3)The same tests when performed on small config device.

Conclusions:

1)With repeated connection requests to the localhost,mongodb crashed again.
	Does not even connect again to mongodb, 
 	but to run the next test had to purge and reinstall MongoDB AGAIN
